Welcome to Stable Genius OS.

This package is a kernel, along with some user space programs. The functionality
is somewhat limited and it is certainly not intended to be a fully-fledged
operating system. The author uses it as an experimental and educational project
and, while having no objection to other people using it for a similar purpose,
does not have the time or inclination to help them to do so. Any bug reports,
comments or feature requests are therefore likely to go unheard.

Currently, the kernel is only available for i686. An i686 toolchain is required
for builing. OSDev has a good set of instructions for how to build one
(https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler). Other dependencies include a GRUB
distribution (https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) to add the boot loader to the
boot image, QEMU (https://www.qemu.org/) to run the system, and FUSE
(https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) to create disk images.

See `INSTALL' for some generic instructions on using the `configure' script. It
will usually be necessary to specify the host, eg.
`./configure --host=i686-elf'. The author recommends an out-of-source build.
Since the software is not intended to be 'installed' anywhere, there is no point
in running `make install'. Instead, `make' will build all the binaries and
libraries, then `make run' will create the disk images and launch the system in
an emulator.
